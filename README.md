Hi Everyone!

So, over here, I am making changes and 'commit' -ing to these changes. Any saved changes on Github are called Commits. 

I would have done this live, but we all know that somehow, everything would go wrong had I done that.

Let's see...what else can I put here?

Umm, oh, I've got a joke! 

What do you call a guy with a rubber toe?

Roberto.

<wait for laughter>
